jQuery Mobile Poker Player Client
========

This is a jQuery Mobile application, designed to be cross browser/device. This app will give a player full functionality and control over his/her hand during a poker game that is run by the poker server.  The poker server must be set up and configured separately.  For more information on how the poker game is supposed to run, see the documentation for the Poker Server.

Version
----
This application is designed to work with Poker Server API Version 0.4. This is subject to change.

Technical Stuff
---
This app is based entirely on jQuery and jQuery mobile, with no other JavaScript frameworks. I toyed with the idea of adding something like knockout.js, but it seemed like overkill for the scope of this project.  It was also nice to get a feel for what JQM can do by itself, without aid of third party libraries.

As this project was mostly for me to learn JQM, there are probably some ways to improve performance or other optimizations.  Pull requests are always welcome.
